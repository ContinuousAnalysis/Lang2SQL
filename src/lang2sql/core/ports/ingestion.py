"""Ingestion ports — document → semantic candidates (★③).

A Source × Extractor matrix: one new Source automatically pairs with every
Extractor. V1 = file upload × LLM extraction; v1.5 adds URL source + DDL
parser, etc. Extracted candidates are shown for user confirm before landing in
the semantic layer (documents are the source of truth).
