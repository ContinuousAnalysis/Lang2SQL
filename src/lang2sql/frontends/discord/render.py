"""render — agent answer → :class:`OutboundMessage` (pure, no discord import).

v4.1 §4.1 sets the response rule: a small result goes back as text, a large one
(> :data:`MAX_INLINE_ROWS`) is attached as a CSV with a short text summary so a
Discord message never balloons past what a human skims. Keeping this pure means
``bot.py`` only has to turn an :class:`OutboundMessage` into a ``discord.File``
or a plain reply — all the threshold logic is unit-tested here.
