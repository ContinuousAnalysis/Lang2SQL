"""V1 safety pipeline regressions — the 12 CI-gate cases from §4.5.

Gate-time vs exec-time distinction
----------------------------------
The Whitelist + Timeout pipeline only decides whether SQL is *allowed to run*.
It does NOT execute SQL, so anything whose failure surfaces only when the query
actually runs against the DB is an EXECUTION-time concern and PASSes the gate:

  * #6 SELECT * FROM nonexistent  -> PG raises at run time (gate PASSes)
  * #7 SELECT pg_sleep(60)        -> bounded by ctx.timeout_seconds at run time
  * #8 SELECT * FROM huge_table   -> truncated by row_limit at run time

The Timeout layer is itself an exec-config layer: it sets ctx.timeout_seconds
and PASSes; it never inspects SQL for slow constructs. So #7's protection shows
up as "PASS + timeout configured", not as a BLOCK.

Only the statement-shape violations (#1-5, #12) BLOCK; #9/#10/#11 PASS.
