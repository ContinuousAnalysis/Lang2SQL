"""Discord frontend (Phase 1) — the V1 chat interface over the harness.

``bot.py`` is the only module that imports discord.py; ``session_router``,
``render``, and ``commands`` are pure and unit-testable. Importing this package
does not import discord.py — ``bot`` is loaded lazily on demand — so the pure
layer (and its tests) stay free of the gateway dependency.
