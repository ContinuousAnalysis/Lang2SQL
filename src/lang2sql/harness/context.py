"""HarnessContext — the assembled unit handed to every turn and every tool.

v4.1 §2.1 describes the harness as "one bundled thing": LLM + tools + scope-
aware semantic + session + safety + explorer + audit. The ContextConcierge
(tenancy) builds one of these per request; the agent loop and ctx-aware tools
read from it. Optional fields are the pieces a bare CLI smoke-test can omit.
