"""E-commerce demo — Lang2SQL v4.1 headline value, no Discord and no real DB.

Run:  .venv/bin/python bench/ecommerce_demo.py

This is the study-group demo. It exercises the *real* V1 code paths
(``ContextConcierge`` + KV-backed federation + the canned Postgres explorer +
the offline ``FakeLLM``) to show three things end-to-end without a token or a
live database:

  Section 1 — define three e-commerce metrics in a channel and read them back.
  Section 2 — ★④ semantic federation: the *same* term ``active_user`` carries
              two different definitions in #marketing vs #finance, with no
              conflict. Each channel resolves its own effective layer.
  Section 3 — ★① safety pipeline: DROP / INSERT are blocked fail-closed while a
              plain SELECT passes.

Everything printed is produced by running the shipped modules, not hard-coded.
